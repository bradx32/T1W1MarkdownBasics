## Headings
We add headings using the # character.

### Emphasis

Some *text* with _italic emphasis_.  
Some __text__ with **bold emphasis**.

### Lists
You can create un-ordered lists by beginning a line with *, +, or -, followed by a space.

You can create ordered lists by beginning lines with a number, followed by a full-stop and a space.

* An  
* Un-ordered
* List
    * With a tabbed sub-point
    * Or two
1. This
2. One
3. Is
4. Ordered

    2. Here too

### Code Blocks
* Surround your code in triple-backticks.
* Some renderers will even highlight special terms from the programming language if you note which language you're using after the top set of backticks.

```
# This is a code block.
print("Hello world.")
```

```python
# This is a language-aware code-block.
print("Hello world")
```

### Hyperlinks
Link text comes first, wrapped in square brackets [].

Link destination follows with no space between, wrapped in round brackets ().

### Images
* First, indicate that an image is being inserted by placing an exclamation point !.
* Next, put alt text in square brackets [].
* Finally, include the address of the desired image in round brackets ().

Here the . in the address means "the folder that contains this document", so no matter where that folder is moved, this path will still point to the image correctly.
